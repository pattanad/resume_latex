\opening{Dear Recruiter,} 
 
 This letter is with regards to the job opportunity "Software Engineer - Chrome"
 that Google Labs has to offer. I came accross this
 opportunity when I was searching for jobs in LinkedIn and I found it 
 to be a very good match with my skills and I feel I could be a
 good fit. 

 I have been working in IBM for the past 4 years and 8 months. I have been
 developing applications for AT\&T client. The primary development language has been C++. I am well
 versed with Object Oriented Programming concepts and have designed and
 developed end to end systems. The application that I have been working on has a large
 C++ code base which involes multi-threaded programming, STL usage and numerous
 data structures. I have a good understanding of SQL databases, as the project
 involves millions of database transactions in large scale systems with query
 optimization being a key factor. I have also written scripts in bash which helps analyze and debug the code
 base more efficiently. 
 
 I am a passionate programmer and this has been shown in the
 numerous awards that I received as a software developer in IBM. 
 
 I look forward for an opportunity to demonstrate my abilities and would be
 eager to hear from you. I could be contacted either by mail -
 manasa.mahesh7@gmail.com or by phone - (732)-210-8297. Thank you for your patience and time to consider my
 candidacy for this opportunity.
