SoC Performance Architecture team, Irvine, CA
(Internship)
• Developed a static analysis tool using the LLVM-Clang compiler infrastructure which was used to optimize memory
utilization in the production environment of a mobile chipset. [C++, LLVM/Clang]

Alcatel-Lucent (Wireless BU), Bangalore, India
Mar 2010 - Aug 2012
MGR(MultiGeneration Radio) Platform Team
(Senior Software Engineer)
• Code development for the low level platform APIs ready to be by various applications like Call-processor, Operation
and Management Services of the 3G base stations (called as NodeB). [C]
• Target Environments : Linux and VxWorks operating systems

Alcatel-Lucent (Ventures), Bangalore, India
NLG (Nonstop Laptop Guardian) Team

Jul 2008 - Feb 2010
(Software Engineer)
[C]
• Environment consisted of Unix and C code base with Operating System concepts, Device Drivers, File Systems,
Socket programming and IPC

SELECT ACADEMIC PROJECTS
• Multimedia Benchmarking on an emulated ARMv8 ISA
Winter 2013
Emulation/Simulation of an ARMv8 ISA using ARMs Foundation models, boot up a Linux operating system and
benchmark the MediaBench multimedia benchmark after cross-compiling the software and profiling it on the ARM
ISA using the perf utility. [C]
• Software Synthesis of a MP3 decoder using SpecC
Spring 2013
Study the SpecC language and perform software synthesis of the MP3 audio decoder (MAD - libmad). It involves
modeling of the system using HW/SW codesign. [C]
• An Optimizing Compiler written for a MIPS architecture
Winter 2013
Construction of a compiler from first principles with optimizations such as Copy propagation and Common Subex-
pression Elimination for a simple programming language on MIPS architecture. [Java]
• Compiler Security
Ongoing
Randomize Instruction Scheduling (for ARM ISA )thereby changing the signature of the binary making it difficult to
reverse engineer using ROP (Return Oriented Programming) techniques. [C++, LLVM/Clang]
• Other projects include Implementation of a Boolean SAT solver, Study on Power efficiency in Heterogenous
Multiprocessor Architecture and Static Analysis of programs using SOOT infrastructure performing DFA, 0-
CFA and 1-CFA analysis. [Java, SOOT]
